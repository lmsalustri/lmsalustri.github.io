			<h2>Special Interest Spotlight: Classic Rock</h2>
			<p class=author>by Laurie Salustri | October 9, 2024</p>
			<article>
				<p>
					Classic rock is a special interest of mine that has remained constant throughout my entire life.
					My parents grew up listening to it, and we always have 80s on 8 or Classic Rewind playing on the radio when we’re in the car.
					My parents actually bonded through Billy Joel.
					My bands of interest align with my dad's favorite bands.
					He enjoys Billy Joel, Yes, Van Halen, and Genesis.
					My top three artists on Spotify are Billy Joel, Queen, and Van Halen.
				</p>
				<p>
					Billy Joel has always stuck with me since I was little.
					My parents took me at age 9 to see him in concert at Madison Square Garden.
					I knew almost every song, and as each one started, I announced the title after just a few notes.
					My parents and the people around us were stunned!
					There were only a few deep cuts I didn’t recognize, but I had a blast.
					My favorite Billy Joel album is <i>The Stranger</i>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started getting deeply into Queen during the pandemic, and my favorite album is <i>A Night at the Opera</i>.
					Last year, I went to a Queen &amp; Adam Lambert concert with my mom, and it was phenomenal.
					We knew every single song!
					I especially loved how they paid tribute to Freddie Mercury by showing videos of him singing "Love of My Life" and "Ay-Oh" at Wembley Stadium.
					I recently saw <i>Queen: Rock Montreal</i> in IMAX with my friends.
					It felt like I was there seeing Freddie live.
					Freddie Mercury’s voice is irreplaceable, and his talent still blows me away every time I listen.
					I wish Freddie were still around.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for Van Halen, I prefer the David Lee Roth era.
					When I was little, I made a playlist for my 6th birthday party and included "Jump" as a jumping song—it was a hit!
					For all three of these bands, if you ask me, "what's your favorite song?" I cannot narrow it down to a single favorite.
