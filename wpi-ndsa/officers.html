                <p class="major">Computer Science, Class of 2027</p>
                <p class="bio">I was diagnosed with autism at age 6, and my experiences have shaped my passion for advocacy.
                    My special interests include classic rock, computers, dogs, and crochet.
                    I have two wonderful dogs, Lucy and Ruby, who are a huge part of my life.
                    I enjoy listening to my favorite artists: Billy Joel, Queen, and Van Halen.
                    As president, I’m committed to building an inclusive community where neurodivergent students feel accepted, supported, and empowered.
                    I believe in fostering a community that emphasizes inclusion and understanding, and I’m committed to advocating for our voices to be heard.</p>

                <p class="name">Alexandra Angell</p>
                <p class="major">Chemistry, Class of 2027</p>
                <p class="bio">I was recently diagnosed with autism and ADHD, but I've been surrounded by neurodivergence my whole life.
                    My special interests include chemistry (hence my major), biology, crafting, and dogs.
                    My go-to fun fact for icebreakers is that I have four dogs: two big German shepherds and two little mini mutts.
                    I listen to a lot of different music, but I especially enjoy indie rock, punk, and grunge.
                    I'm excited to be part of the NDSA executive board and help foster a community for neurodivergent students at WPI.</p>

                <p class="major">Environmental Engineering w/ Mathematical Sciences Minor, Class of 2027</p>
                <p class="bio">I have been diagnosed with autism and OCD since the age of two.
                    With this, I've had to navigate the world of accommodations and represent neurodivergent people throughout my life.
                    I'm interested in math, the environment, and my favorite video game, Minecraft.
                    As an environmental engineering major with a mathematical sciences minor, I hope to research mathematical models of the environment after my time at WPI.
                    I hope to help the club make meaningful change for neurodivergent individuals within the WPI community with my position as secretary. </p>

                <p class="bio">I was diagnosed with Asperger's at 15 years old.
                    One of my teachers recommended for me to get tested in 9th grade, and it has helped me understand and have more compassion for myself.
                    My special interests are dogs, swimming, and violin.
                    I also like to travel because I have lived in 3 states and 3 countries.</p>
