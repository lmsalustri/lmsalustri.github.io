            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                The Neurodivergent Student Association, originally known as Spectrum Friends, was founded in 2021 by Kathryn Stovall '24 to provide a voice and support system for autistic students at WPI.
                It was later expanded by Stovall and Laurie Salustri '27 to include all neurodiverse identities.
                In 2024, under the administration of Salustri, Valerie Bennett '24, Abigail Deichert '24, and Ian Grzembski '24, the NDSA became officially recognized by WPI.
                The association has since partnered with key WPI offices, including the Heebner Career Development Center and the Student Development & Counseling Center.

                    <p class="bio">I was evaluated for autism around the age of 7 because my mother wanted to prove to my autistic father that I was "normal."
					However, the testing revealed that I likely had autism and definitely had severe ADHD. Instead of seeing my diagnosis as something being horribly wrong with me, my mother saw it as a sign that I just needed a little extra support.
					She became my biggest advocate, fighting for me to be treated as an intelligent person rather than just a learning disability.
					It is important for neurodivergent people to feel empowered enough to advocate for themselves, and this is something my mother taught me how to do.
					I was fortunate to grow up with parents who gave me the skills to self-advocate, as that is not the reality for most people.
					This is why I started the Discord server and helped found the Neurodivergent Student Association at WPI.
					I wanted to create a space where the neurodivergent community at WPI could come together to support each other and help one another advocate for themselves in both academic and social settings.</p>

                        My special interests include classic rock, computers, dogs, and crochet.

                        I enjoy listening to my favorite artists: Billy Joel, Queen, and Van Halen.
                        As president, I’m committed to building an inclusive community where neurodivergent students feel accepted, supported, and empowered.
                        I believe in fostering a community that emphasizes inclusion and understanding, and I’m committed to advocating for our voices to be heard.</p>

						My special interests include chemistry (hence my major), biology, crafting, and dogs.
						My go-to fun fact for icebreakers is that I have four dogs: two big German shepherds and two little mini mutts.
						I listen to a lot of different music, but I especially enjoy indie rock, punk, and grunge.
						I'm excited to be part of the NDSA executive board and help foster a community for neurodivergent students at WPI.</p>
